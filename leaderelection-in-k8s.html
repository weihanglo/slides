### Goals

- Understand common properties of learder election algorithm

- Understand leader election algorithm in K8s

- Demo time?

### Leader election algorithm

Pros

- Redundancy

- Reducing coordination

- Improving efficiency

Cons

- Introduces failure mode

- Scaling bottleneck

---

### Properties 1, 2, 3, 4


One leader

- Should only get one leader in a election

Two states

- Elected
- Non-elected

Three conditions

- Termination
- Uniqueness
- Agreement

Four aspects

- Communication mechanism
- Process names
- Network topology
- Size of the network

---

### How `client-go` elects leaders?

- Atomicity depends on K8s API atomicity (resource as some sort of Lock primitive)
  - ResourceVersions - Every API object has a unique ResourceVersion, and you can use these versions to perform compare-and-swap on Kubernetes objects
  - Annotations - Every API object can be annotated with arbitrary key/value pairs to be used by clients.

- Lease-based
    - Single database store who's current leader
    - Heartbeat telling everyone I am alive
    - Depends on time elapse duration (not wall-clock time)

---

### `client-go` properties

- Does not guarantee that only one client is acting as a leader (a.k.a. no fencing).

- A client only acts on timestamps captured locally to infer the state of the leader election (instead of a global timestamp).

- Depnds on changes not accuracy
  - Tolerant to arbitrary clock skew
  - Not tolerant to arbitrary clock skew rate.

---

### `client-go` architecture

Two parts

- Resource Lock (API Object)
  - Create/Get/Update lock

- Eelector
  - Run the election
  - Acquire/Release lock -> depends on resource lock
  - Update lock -> depends on resource lock

---

### What happens when a leader fails?

- Two separate steps
  - "make work durable"
  - "tell others it is complete"

- One important property: idempotency (or via optimistic locking)

---

### Use Cases

- kube-scheduler

- kube-controller-manager

- snapshot-controller

- cluster-autoscaler
