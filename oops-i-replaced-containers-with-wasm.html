## What are today's objective?

- Know what WebAssembly is

- Know what WebAssembly isn't

- Know what WebAssembly can

- Know what WebAssembly cannot

---

## Is Wasm an assembly?

Yes!

- A binary instruction format for a virtual machine
- A compilation target: LLVM to Wasm
- [With well-defined specifications][core spec]

## Is Wasm an assembly?

```wasm
(func (param $p i32)
  (result i32)
  local.get $p
  local.get $p
  i32.add)
```

```wasm
(module
  (import "js" "memory" (memory 1))
  (import "js" "table" (table 1 funcref))
  (type $void_to_i32 (func (result i32)))
  (func (export "doIt") (result i32)
   i32.const 0
   i32.const 42
   i32.store  ;; store 42 at address 0
   i32.const 0
   call_indirect (type $void_to_i32))
)
```

## You mentioned VM. Is Wasm a VM?

Yes!

- ‚ùå A duplication of a computer system

- ‚úÖ A managed programming runtime environment

---

## You mentioned VM. Is Wasm a VM?

- üëå Portability\*: Write once. ~~Debug~~ Embed anywhere.

- üëå Security: VM controls the environment.

- üöÄ Performance: Faster runtime and startup time.

- üöÄ More security: Everything is an import.

\*: [Assumptions apply]

### [`binop` execution](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/exec/instructions.html#t-mathsf-xref-syntax-instructions-syntax-binop-mathit-binop)

### Definition of [`modules`]

<img width="80%", src="oops-i-replaced-containers-with-wasm/modules.png">

---

## What really is Wasm?


Assembly / Instruction Set

### +

Execution (with an implementation)

> Types, values, instructions, executions. All these are defined in [core spec].

---

## Sounds like a JVM. Why faster?

- üëç Codegen and optimization via modern compiler backend.
- üëç Stream-line, parallelized parsing and decoding = [fast startup time]
- üëç No GC. You got the whole linear address space.
- üëé Actually it is [not so fast].
- üëé Maybe just [equally fast] when [comparing with JavaScript].

---

## What about the security part?

This is the part that Wasm really shines!

- Has no system call
- Has no API
- Shared-nothing in mind

The only way to communicate with outside world is:

<center><h3>Module Imports<h3></center>

Like [Linux capabilities] but need to define your own capabilites.

---

## So far, we know WebAssembly

**... is**

- an ISA with both text and binary format

- an execution of its instructions

**... is not**

- a virtual machine that duplicates the whole OS

- a crypto scheme

## Wait. No API no syscall? 

## That's totally useless!

Indeed.

But we have module imports.

---

## You mean an interface?

Exactly. There are some embedding interfaces specs:

- [JavaScript API]: Define how to export and import JavaScript objects and environments.

- [WASI - WebAssembly System Interface]: "System calls" for WebAssembly, including filesystem, sockets, etc.

<img width="70%" src="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/41d8c27/docs/wasi-software-architecture.png?raw=true">

---

## So, we need to impl WASI for different archs on our own?

Not really. You can choose a runtime and use it directly.

## Is this Wasm on the web?

- Games

- Audio. Video. Graphics

- Machine learning and scientific Computing

- Web frameworks in other programming languages (C#, Rust)

- Any compute-intensive apps

- Just porting C/C++ project to the web and boom! (
  - mostly via [Emscripten]

- Storage and rendering still need some rewrites and glue code with Web API
  - OpenGL to WebGL

  - POSIX API to IndexedDB or web file APIs

---

## What about outside the web?

Edge and distributed computing. But why Cloud Native WebAssembly?

- Fast startup and small footprint
- Wasm engine is small and simple to optimize
- Security (built-in sandboxing)

<img height="24px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Fastly_logo.svg/320px-Fastly_logo.svg.png"> [Compute@Edge]
- Every request is a code start of a Wasm runtime within 50ms

<img height="24px" src="https://github.com/wasmCloud/branding/blob/main/02.Horizontal Version/Vector/SVG/Wasmcloud.Logo-Hrztl_Color.svg?raw=true"> [OTP Wasm computing platform]
- Introduce [waPC], a protocol of procedural calls between native hosts and Wasm guests.

<img height="24px" src="https://www.secondstate.io/assets/img/logo.png"> [FaaS]
- Has its own [WasmEdge] runtime, which is a CNCF project since earlier this year.

---

## What about outside the web?

[Krustlet: Flee from a gigantic platform to the other]

- Replace kubelet and run WebAssembly workload inside Kubernetes

- [wasm-to-oci] uses OCI registries to distribute Wasm modules

![](https://krustlet.dev/images/horizontal.svg)
---

## What about outside the web?

Suitable for blockchain and smart contract VM

- Memory-safe. Sandboxed. Secure.

- Langugage-indenpendant. Write smart contracts with any language you like

- Wasm is well-defined. No need to reinvent the wheel for another sandboxed VM.

- Deterministic\*.

## What about outside the web?

Actually, the line between web and non-web is getting vaguer.

- Edge computing and serverless

- Blockchain. Smart contract.

- Embedded environment

- Any dedicated computing engine
   - Policy engine: [Kubewarden], [Open Policy Agent]

   - Http filters: [Envoy]

   - Run pre-compiled code to speed up compile: [Watt]

## Can I replace containers with Wasm?

No. Not in the near feature. Take resources control for example, container has 
cgroup and namespaces, whereas Wasm lacks for fine-grained system resource
managemnet.

Also, Wasm is under rapid devlopement. Feature like [Component Model], which
provides module linking without host initiation, has not yet stabilized.
Without proper interfaces between system and Wasm modules, writing Wasm for 
impure computation workload would still be in flux.

After all, they serves for different purposes in design at first.
