## Rust Features

- **Memory safety (without GC)**
- **No data race**
- Minimal runtime
- High-level abstraction
- **Great build system**
- Powerful macro

---
class: middle, left

## Define Memory Safety

- No null pointer dereferences
- No dangling pointers
  - No double free
  - No use-after-free
- No out-of-bound-access
  - No buffer overflow
- No data race??

Wiki: [Memory safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety)

---
class: middle, left

## Unsafe in C++

```c++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>

using std;

int main() {
    std::vector<std::string> v;

    v.push_back("Hello, ");

    std::string &x = v[0];

    v.push_back("world!"); // Problem occurs
    
    std::cout << x;
}
```

... and cannot compile this snippet on my macbook

---
class: middle, left

## Memory Safety in Rust

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = Vec::new();
    
    s.push("Hello, ");
    
    let x = &s[0];
    
    s.push("world!");
    
    println!("{:?}", s);
}
```

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed 
                 as immutable
  --> src/main.rs:8:5
6  |     let x = &s[0];
   |              - immutable borrow occurs here
7  |
8  |     s.push("world!");
   |     ^ mutable borrow occurs here
...
11 | }
   | - immutable borrow ends here
```

## Memory Safety in Rust

Forced initialization + Ownership + Restricted aliasing

### = Memory safety

<span style="font-size: 0.8em">all at compile time!</span>

---
class: middle, left

## Forced Initialization

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
}
```

Compiled without crashes.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

```
error[E0381]: use of possibly uninitialized variable: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:3:20
  |
3 |     println!("{}", x);
  |                    ^ use of possibly uninitialized `x`
```

---
class: middle, left

## Forced Initialization

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: i32;
    if true {
        x = 10;
    } else {
        x = 20;
    }
    println!("{}", x);
}
```

Initialize `x` before using. Compiled without surprises.

### What about null pointer?

---
class: middle, left

## Rust has no null pointers

Instead, Rust borrows the concepts
[Option type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_type)
from functional programming.

An option type encapsulates null inside a container, 
forcing programmers to **think about the nullability before implementing**.

Without Option type, every single varible could be null and cause null pointer exceptions.

---
class: middle, left

## `Option<T>`

[`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/) is just an enum in Rust. 

```rust
pub enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

Pattern matching with `Option` as an normal enum is like a breeze.

```rust
fn main() {
    let maybe = Some(2);
    match maybe {
        Some(p) => println!("has value {}", p),
        None => println!("has no value"),
    }
    // or `maybe.unwrap()`
}
```

```
> has value 2
```

---
class: middle, left

## Ownership

Rust Ownership Rules

1. Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped ([RAII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAII)).

> Rust guarantees its memory safety by restricting variables from aliasing.

## Move semantics

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1; // s2 is the new owner.

println!("{}, world!", s1); // Error. Value is moved.
```

## Scope and RAII

```rust
fn make_string() {
    let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward
    println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {
    make_string();
    // the scope of make_string is over.
    // s is dropped immediately. No GC.
}
```

## How to share data between variables?

Answer: resctrict aliasing with borrow checker.

> This is the one of the most intimidating part of Rust.

---
class: middle, left

## Borrow

| ˈbɒrəʊ |

_verb_

Take and use (something belonging to someone else) with the intention of **returning** it

---
class: middle, left

## Borrow Checker

To guarantee data synchronization and prevent data racing,
all references in Rust must follow at lease two rules:

- Having 
  - several immutable references (`&T`) or 
  - exact one mutable reference (`&mut T`).
- A reference must always be valid even it references to null.  
  (use `Option<T>` representing null pointer)

> Q: When will the borrowing returned from a reference?  
> A: A reference would return its borrowing when it goes out of scope (RAII).



---
class: middle, left

### Borrow Checker: several immutable refs

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &s;
    let r2 = &s;
    let r3 = &s;
    println!("{} {} {}", r1, r2, r3);
}
```

```
> hello hello hello
```

---
class: middle, left

### Borrow Checker: exact one mutable ref

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
        println!("r1 {}", r1);
    } // r1 returns the borrowing, so we can make a new reference.

    let r2 = &mut s;
    println!("r2 {}", r2);
}
```


---
class: middle, left

### Borrow Checker: cannot mix mutable with immutable refs

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
}
```

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable because it is also borrowed as
immutable
 --> borrow_thrice.rs:6:19
  |
4 |     let r1 = &s; // no problem
  |               - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |     let r2 = &s; // no problem
6 |     let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
  |                   ^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 | }
  | - immutable borrow ends here
```
